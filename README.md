# Medicinall's Guide to PUSH 2: A vast wealth of compiled knowledge available on the web.

A learning guide for Push 2 Enthusiasts. This is a comprehensive guide for all push 2 users and music producers.  This is meant to be a compiled resource guide. The material that this contains has been made by others.  

## USER STORY

I have spent the last 5 years learning how to compose music in Abelton session while getting my production down and my sound clean.  It has been quite the learning experiance.   Arrangement view is easy and linear.  Session View is a whole other animal.  I have talked to other producers and they hate that Abelton confuses them they couldn't explain why they just hate it.  The more I talked to them the more I discovered that it was to much programming in Session View.  They just want to create and play. Then you have the producers who LOVE session view and the organization of its pieces.  I  LOVE SESSION VIEW as much as I love Arrangement View.  I am happy to report that I am beginnning understand how to compose in session view and make it so that I can play a live set in it if I get all the parts in order.  Thats great but what if I want to compose live and play my push like the instrument it was meant to be?  

This is why I have compiled this source book.  I want to be able to use this as a reference and go back to my favorite sources and look info up in all one place.

I wanted to create a guide where I could have a ton of resources on every subject for the Push 2 in one location and this is what I came up with. As I delve deeper into Abelton I will compile their manual to their videos so it makes this a much easier learning tool.  I will also be putting articale and videos not produced by Abelton but cover the same subject matter.  

Learning should be fun and easy and hopefully this guide will take some of the work out of researching.

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

I hate that most manuals put the shortcuts at the end buried under tons of other information.  Keyboard shortcuts save us time and we can get back to producing.  This is why they are front and center here.

## Settings and Managing Files in Abelton

The Settings area is your best friend get to know and understand what each setting does and how you can personalize your production experiance.  Settings can be found in the Options menu on Windows and in the Live menu on macOS. You can also open the Settings window using the shortcut Ctrl, (Win) / Cmd, (Mac).

#### FILE MANAGEMENT

This is very crucial but file management is often overlooked until it is to late and then you spend a week crying on your computer and praying to your chosen god or goddess that you didn't delete something crucial.  The sooner you learn this the less stress and more composing you can do.

Various types of files are used in making music with Live, from those containing MIDI and audio, to more program-specific files such as Live Clips and Live Sets. This chapter will explain everything you need to know about working with each of these file types in Live.

## Table of Contents


## THE MANUAL

What everyone should read but no one does until they need specifics.  This is a handy guide into the Push 2.  I didn't realize the things this beautiful machine could do until I had been playing with it for 2 years.  It's when I started looking into using it as my main tool for live performance that I began to understand why people love this thing.  I also understand why people open it up and then never use it again.  There is so much to learn it becomes overwhelming.  I don't blame people for quitting.  Abelton as a program is vast and when you pair it with a controller that can open the universe, it takes a brave soul to not run away screaming.

## Step Sequencing Beats

"Step sequencing beats" in Ableton means creating a drum beat by programming individual notes (or "steps") in a sequence, where each step represents a specific rhythmic division within a bar, allowing you to build a rhythm pattern by activating specific steps in a grid-like interface, usually using the pads on a controller like Ableton Push, to trigger different drum sounds one after another to form a beat. 
Learn how to program beats using the step sequencer on Ableton Push.

- Key points about step sequencing beats in Ableton:
  
Grid-based interface:
The step sequencer displays a grid where each column represents a "step" and can be programmed with a note to trigger a sound. 

Customizable step length:
You can adjust the length of each step to create different rhythmic patterns, like 16th notes, 8th notes, triplets, etc. 

Drum Rack integration:
Most commonly used with a Drum Rack, which allows you to easily select different drum sounds on each step. 

Live recording:
You can also record a beat in real-time by pressing the pads in sequence, and the software will quantize the notes to the selected step length. 

How to step sequence beats in Ableton:

1. **Select a drum rack:**
Load a drum rack in your MIDI track to access various drum sounds. 

2. **Choose a step length:**
Set the desired step division (e.g., 16th notes) in the step sequencer settings. 

3. **Trigger steps:**
Press the corresponding pads on your controller to activate the desired drum sounds on each step. 

4. **Build a pattern:**
Repeat this process to create a complete rhythmic pattern across multiple steps. 

**Benefits of step sequencing:** 
Intuitive rhythm creation: The visual grid makes it easy to visualize and manipulate rhythms. 
Rapid prototyping: Quickly experiment with different beat variations by changing the active steps. 
Precise control: Fine-tune the timing and velocity of each step for detailed rhythm creation.

## PLAYING DRUMS IN ABLETON

Drums are the foundation of music.  Playing drums in ableton is a great way to make your track stand out. 
Drums are considered one of the most important instruments in music because they provide the rhythmic foundation, setting the tempo and driving the energy of a song, essentially acting as the "timekeeper" that keeps all other instruments in sync and allows for dynamic shifts in intensity and emotion within a piece; without drums, music can often feel lackluster and unfocused. 

Drums are primarily responsible for creating the rhythmic pulse that listeners naturally move to, providing a clear sense of time and structure within a song. 

A drummer can significantly influence the mood of a song by adjusting the tempo, dynamics, and patterns, adding energy, excitement, or a sense of calm depending on the situation. 

Different drum styles and techniques can be used to create a wide range of sounds and textures, adapting to various musical genres.

## Melodies in Ableton

A melody in a song acts as the "tune" or main musical line, defining the song's character, conveying emotions, and serving as the most memorable part that listeners typically recognize and hum along to; essentially, it's the sequence of notes that tells the musical story within a song. 

A melody is what distinguishes one song from another, making it the most recognizable element.  By using different pitch patterns and rhythms, a melody can convey a wide range of emotions, from joy to sadness. 
The melody dictates the order and duration of notes, forming the overall structure of the song.  A good melody is often considered "catchy" because it is easy to remember and sing along to. 

A melody can be defined as a sequence of single notes that are musically pleasing to the listener. It's the part of a song which is most memorable and is often referred to as the tune.

A melody is one of the basic elements of music. Melodies are the part of music that is above the chords and rhythm. They can come in many shapes and sizes, and can have lyrics or be instrumental. They can be played very high, or very low. We can hear them played by instruments like a violin, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, or sung by a voice. The most important thing to remember is that they are always only one pitch at a time. 

Musical ideas can be hard to explain and are often defined by using complex Italian music terms, or using difficult music theory — but Melody may be the simplest and easiest musical concept musicians have.

[Lesson 1: Melody Writing with MIDI](https://www.ableton.com/en/classroom/support/theory-hacks/lesson-1/)
## Chords In Ableton

A chord in music is a group of notes that are played simultaneously to create harmony. Chords are built from intervals of notes, such as thirds and fifths. 
Types of chords: 

Triad: A chord made up of three notes: a root note, a third, and a fifth 

7th chord: A chord made up of four notes, also known as a tetrad 

Extended chord: A chord made up of five or more notes 

Diminished chord: A chord made up of a root note, a minor third, and a diminished fifth 

Augmented chord: A chord made up of a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth 

Chord qualities: 

Consonant: A chord that implies repose

Dissonant: A chord that implies resolution to another chord
Uses of chords 

Accompaniment: Chords provide the backdrop for melodies

Songwriting: Chord progressions are often the starting point for writing songs
Improvisation: Understanding chords helps musicians improvise

Arrangement: Chords are important for arranging music for different instruments and ensembles

## CHROMATIC NOTE MODE

Chromatic note mode is a mode on some musical instruments that allows the player to access all 12 notes of an octave. It can be used to create melodies, embellish other scales, or tune instruments. 

How it works:

The chromatic scale is made up of all the white and black keys on a piano. 
Each note in the chromatic scale is a half step apart. 
Sharps move up a half step, while flats move down a half step. 
The chromatic scale doesn't have a tonal center, so it doesn't gravitate towards a particular tone. 

When to use it:

Leads: Chromatic mode can be used to create leads. 
Classical impressionism: Chromatic mode can be used to create a classical impressionist sound. 
Pitch bending: Chromatic mode can be used for pitch bending. 
Tuning: Chromatic mode can be used to tune an instrument to any of the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale. 
Embellishing other scales: Chromatic mode can be used to embellish the tones of major and minor scales.
Evoking emotion: Chromatic mode can be used to evoke grief, loss, or sorrow.

## Melodic Parts

Melodic parts are the notes that make up the tune, or melody, of a piece of music. The melody is often the most memorable part of a song. 

Pitch: The notes that make up the melody
Rhythm: The pattern of pitches in time
Structure: The arrangement of notes, including intervals, scales, motifs, and phrasing
Dynamics: How loud or soft the melody is played
Texture: The density of the layers of sounds, melodies, and rhythms
Timbre: The quality of the sound

In this Ableton Push tutorial video you’ll learn how to transform and tweak sounds by adjusting the parameters or adding effects.

# Melodic Step Sequencing with Ableton Push

Learn how to step sequence notes and chords with the melodic step sequencer on Ableton Push.

To step sequence notes and chords using the melodic step sequencer on Ableton Push, press the "Layout" button to access the melodic step sequencer mode, then simply press the pads corresponding to the desired notes on the grid, where each pad represents a step in the sequence; you can play single notes or chords by pressing multiple pads simultaneously depending on the scale you've selected. 

Key points to remember:

Accessing the Melodic Step Sequencer: Press the "Layout" button on Push to toggle between different modes, including the melodic step sequencer. 

Playing Notes: Once in the melodic step sequencer, the pads will represent notes of a chosen scale, with the bottom row typically being the root notes and the top row an octave higher. 

Creating Chords: To play a chord, press multiple pads within the same step simultaneously. 

Navigating the Scale: Use the scale controls on Push to select the desired scale and root note. 

Step Length and Resolution: Adjust the step length and resolution using the dedicated buttons on Push to control how long each note lasts within the sequence.

### NOTEMODE SETTINGS

Learn how to adjust settings for playing notes on Ableton Push.

On a Push 2, the "Note Mode" settings allow you to control which notes are accessible on the pads, primarily by choosing between "In Key" mode (only playing notes within the current key) and "Chromatic" mode (playing all notes), and further customizing the layout of the pads by selecting a specific scale and interval structure using the "Scale" button, enabling you to easily play melodies within a chosen key or scale by simply pressing the corresponding pads on the grid. 

Key points about Note Mode settings on Push 2:

In Key vs. Chromatic:
The primary setting is choosing between "In Key" (only notes from the current key are accessible) and "Chromatic" (all notes are playable). 

Scale Selection:
You can further customize the "In Key" mode by selecting a specific scale, which determines which notes within the key are available on the pads. 

Scale Layout:
The layout of the scale can be adjusted, allowing you to play intervals like thirds or fourths by moving across the pads. 

Accessing Note Mode Settings:
Usually, you can access these settings by pressing the "Scale" button on the Push 2 display, which will then allow you to change the key and scale using the encoders.

# Drum Patterns, Loops, and Legalities COPYWRITING

In most cases, if you use a drum pattern from another song that is easily recognizable and considered a unique part of the original composition, you would likely need to license it, as simply copying a distinct drum pattern could be considered copyright infringement, even if drum patterns alone aren't usually directly copyrightable; however, if you are using a very basic or common rhythm pattern, it might not be considered infringement. 

Basic rhythms are not copyrightable:
Common drum patterns like a simple backbeat or a four-on-the-floor groove are generally considered too generic to be protected by copyright, meaning you can likely use them without licensing. 

Unique and distinctive patterns are:
If a drum pattern is particularly recognizable and considered a key element of a song, like a famous drum fill or a complex rhythmic arrangement, using it without permission could be copyright infringement. 

Sampling vs. playing:
If you are directly sampling a drum loop from another recording, you would definitely need to obtain a license, even if the pattern itself is not unique. 

#### What to do if unsure:

Consult a music lawyer:
If you are unsure whether a specific drum pattern is considered copyrightable or if you want to be completely safe, it's best to consult with a lawyer specializing in music copyright. 

Seek permission:
If you decide to use a recognizable drum pattern, try to contact the original artist or copyright holder to get permission to use it.
