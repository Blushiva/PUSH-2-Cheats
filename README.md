# PUSH 2: A vast wealth of compiled knowledge available on the web.

A learning guide for Push 2 Enthusiasts. This is a comprehensive guide for all push 2 users.  
## USER STORY

I wanted to create a guide where I could have a ton of resources on every subject for the Push 2 in one location and this is what I came up with.

## Table of Contents


## THE MANUAL

What everyone should read but no one does until they need specifics.  This is a handy guide into the Push 2.  I didn't realize the things this beautiful machine could do until I had been playing with it for 2 years.  It's when I started looking into using it as my main tool for live performance that I began to understand why people love this thing.  I also understand why people open it up and then never use it again.  There is so much to learn it becomes overwhelming.  I don't blame people for quitting.  Abelton as a program is vast and when you pair it with a controller that can open the universe, it takes a brave soul to not run away screaming.
