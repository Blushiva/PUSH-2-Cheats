# Medicinall's Guide to PUSH 2: A vast wealth of compiled knowledge available on the web.

A learning guide for Push 2 Enthusiasts. This is a comprehensive guide for all push 2 users and music producers.  This is meant to be a compiled resource guide. The material that this contains has been made by others.  

## USER STORY

I have spent the last 5 years learning how to compose music in Abelton session while getting my production down and my sound clean.  It has been quite the learning experiance.   Arrangement view is easy and linear.  Session View is a whole other animal.  I have talked to other producers and they hate that Abelton confuses them they couldn't explain why they just hate it.  The more I talked to them the more I discovered that it was to much programming in Session View.  They just want to create and play. Then you have the producers who LOVE session view and the organization of its pieces.  I  LOVE SESSION VIEW as much as I love Arrangement View.  I am happy to report that I am beginnning understand how to compose in session view and make it so that I can play a live set in it if I get all the parts in order.  Thats great but what if I want to compose live and play my push like the instrument it was meant to be?  

This is why I have compiled this source book.  I want to be able to use this as a reference and go back to my favorite sources and look info up in all one place.

I wanted to create a guide where I could have a ton of resources on every subject for the Push 2 in one location and this is what I came up with. As I delve deeper into Abelton I will compile their manual to their videos so it makes this a much easier learning tool.  I will also be putting articles and videos not produced by Abelton but cover the same subject material.  

Learning should be fun and easy and hopefully this guide will take some of the work out of researching so you can learn faster.

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

I hate that most manuals put the shortcuts at the end buried under tons of other information.  Keyboard shortcuts save us time and we can get back to producing.  This is why they are front and center here.  

[Keyboard Shortcuts](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/live-keyboard-shortcuts/#live-keyboard-shortcuts)

## Settings and Managing Files in Abelton

The Settings area is your best friend get to know and understand what each setting does and how you can personalize your production experiance.  Settings can be found in the Options menu on Windows and in the Live menu on macOS. You can also open the Settings window using the shortcut Ctrl, (Win) / Cmd, (Mac).

#### FILE MANAGEMENT

This is very crucial but file management is often overlooked until it is to late and then you spend a week crying on your computer and praying to your chosen god or goddess that you didn't delete something crucial.  The sooner you learn this the less stress and more composing you can do.

Various types of files are used in making music with Live, from those containing MIDI and audio, to more program-specific files such as Live Clips and Live Sets. This chapter will explain everything you need to know about working with each of these file types in Live.

## Table of Contents


## THE MANUAL

What everyone should read but no one does until they need specifics.  This is a handy guide into the Push 2.  I didn't realize the things this beautiful machine could do until I had been playing with it for 2 years.  It's when I started looking into using it as my main tool for live performance that I began to understand why people love this thing.  I also understand why people open it up and then never use it again.  There is so much to learn it becomes overwhelming.  I don't blame people for quitting.  Abelton as a program is vast and when you pair it with a controller that can open the universe, it takes a brave soul to not run away screaming.

## Step Sequencing Beats

"Step sequencing beats" in Ableton means creating a drum beat by programming individual notes (or "steps") in a sequence, where each step represents a specific rhythmic division within a bar, allowing you to build a rhythm pattern by activating specific steps in a grid-like interface, usually using the pads on a controller like Ableton Push, to trigger different drum sounds one after another to form a beat. 
Learn how to program beats using the step sequencer on Ableton Push.

- Key points about step sequencing beats in Ableton:
  
Grid-based interface:
The step sequencer displays a grid where each column represents a "step" and can be programmed with a note to trigger a sound. 

Customizable step length:
You can adjust the length of each step to create different rhythmic patterns, like 16th notes, 8th notes, triplets, etc. 

Drum Rack integration:
Most commonly used with a Drum Rack, which allows you to easily select different drum sounds on each step. 

Live recording:
You can also record a beat in real-time by pressing the pads in sequence, and the software will quantize the notes to the selected step length. 

How to step sequence beats in Ableton:

1. **Select a drum rack:**
Load a drum rack in your MIDI track to access various drum sounds. 

2. **Choose a step length:**
Set the desired step division (e.g., 16th notes) in the step sequencer settings. 

3. **Trigger steps:**
Press the corresponding pads on your controller to activate the desired drum sounds on each step. 

4. **Build a pattern:**
Repeat this process to create a complete rhythmic pattern across multiple steps. 

**Benefits of step sequencing:** 
Intuitive rhythm creation: The visual grid makes it easy to visualize and manipulate rhythms. 
Rapid prototyping: Quickly experiment with different beat variations by changing the active steps. 
Precise control: Fine-tune the timing and velocity of each step for detailed rhythm creation.

## PLAYING DRUMS IN ABLETON

Drums are the foundation of music.  Playing drums in ableton is a great way to make your track stand out. 
Drums are considered one of the most important instruments in music because they provide the rhythmic foundation, setting the tempo and driving the energy of a song, essentially acting as the "timekeeper" that keeps all other instruments in sync and allows for dynamic shifts in intensity and emotion within a piece; without drums, music can often feel lackluster and unfocused. 

Drums are primarily responsible for creating the rhythmic pulse that listeners naturally move to, providing a clear sense of time and structure within a song. 

A drummer can significantly influence the mood of a song by adjusting the tempo, dynamics, and patterns, adding energy, excitement, or a sense of calm depending on the situation. 

Different drum styles and techniques can be used to create a wide range of sounds and textures, adapting to various musical genres.

## Melodies in Ableton

A melody in a song acts as the "tune" or main musical line, defining the song's character, conveying emotions, and serving as the most memorable part that listeners typically recognize and hum along to; essentially, it's the sequence of notes that tells the musical story within a song. 

A melody is what distinguishes one song from another, making it the most recognizable element.  By using different pitch patterns and rhythms, a melody can convey a wide range of emotions, from joy to sadness. 
The melody dictates the order and duration of notes, forming the overall structure of the song.  A good melody is often considered "catchy" because it is easy to remember and sing along to. 

A melody can be defined as a sequence of single notes that are musically pleasing to the listener. It's the part of a song which is most memorable and is often referred to as the tune.

A melody is one of the basic elements of music. Melodies are the part of music that is above the chords and rhythm. They can come in many shapes and sizes, and can have lyrics or be instrumental. They can be played very high, or very low. We can hear them played by instruments like a violin, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, or sung by a voice. The most important thing to remember is that they are always only one pitch at a time. 

Musical ideas can be hard to explain and are often defined by using complex Italian music terms, or using difficult music theory — but Melody may be the simplest and easiest musical concept musicians have.

[Lesson 1: Melody Writing with MIDI](https://www.ableton.com/en/classroom/support/theory-hacks/lesson-1/)
## Chords In Ableton

A chord in music is a group of notes that are played simultaneously to create harmony. Chords are built from intervals of notes, such as thirds and fifths. 
Types of chords: 

Triad: A chord made up of three notes: a root note, a third, and a fifth 

7th chord: A chord made up of four notes, also known as a tetrad 

Extended chord: A chord made up of five or more notes 

Diminished chord: A chord made up of a root note, a minor third, and a diminished fifth 

Augmented chord: A chord made up of a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth 

Chord qualities: 

Consonant: A chord that implies repose

Dissonant: A chord that implies resolution to another chord
Uses of chords 

Accompaniment: Chords provide the backdrop for melodies

Songwriting: Chord progressions are often the starting point for writing songs
Improvisation: Understanding chords helps musicians improvise

Arrangement: Chords are important for arranging music for different instruments and ensembles

## CHROMATIC NOTE MODE

Chromatic note mode is a mode on some musical instruments that allows the player to access all 12 notes of an octave. It can be used to create melodies, embellish other scales, or tune instruments. 

How it works:

The chromatic scale is made up of all the white and black keys on a piano. 
Each note in the chromatic scale is a half step apart. 
Sharps move up a half step, while flats move down a half step. 
The chromatic scale doesn't have a tonal center, so it doesn't gravitate towards a particular tone. 

When to use it:

Leads: Chromatic mode can be used to create leads. 
Classical impressionism: Chromatic mode can be used to create a classical impressionist sound. 
Pitch bending: Chromatic mode can be used for pitch bending. 
Tuning: Chromatic mode can be used to tune an instrument to any of the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale. 
Embellishing other scales: Chromatic mode can be used to embellish the tones of major and minor scales.
Evoking emotion: Chromatic mode can be used to evoke grief, loss, or sorrow.

[Understand Chromatic Mode on Ableton PUSH - Course Excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYER7ko668w&t=428s)

## Melodic Parts

Melodic parts are the notes that make up the tune, or melody, of a piece of music. The melody is often the most memorable part of a song. 

Pitch: The notes that make up the melody
Rhythm: The pattern of pitches in time
Structure: The arrangement of notes, including intervals, scales, motifs, and phrasing
Dynamics: How loud or soft the melody is played
Texture: The density of the layers of sounds, melodies, and rhythms
Timbre: The quality of the sound

In this Ableton Push tutorial video you’ll learn how to transform and tweak sounds by adjusting the parameters or adding effects.

# Melodic Step Sequencing with Ableton Push

Learn how to step sequence notes and chords with the melodic step sequencer on Ableton Push.

To step sequence notes and chords using the melodic step sequencer on Ableton Push, press the "Layout" button to access the melodic step sequencer mode, then simply press the pads corresponding to the desired notes on the grid, where each pad represents a step in the sequence; you can play single notes or chords by pressing multiple pads simultaneously depending on the scale you've selected. 

Key points to remember:

Accessing the Melodic Step Sequencer: Press the "Layout" button on Push to toggle between different modes, including the melodic step sequencer. 

Playing Notes: Once in the melodic step sequencer, the pads will represent notes of a chosen scale, with the bottom row typically being the root notes and the top row an octave higher. 

Creating Chords: To play a chord, press multiple pads within the same step simultaneously. 

Navigating the Scale: Use the scale controls on Push to select the desired scale and root note. 

Step Length and Resolution: Adjust the step length and resolution using the dedicated buttons on Push to control how long each note lasts within the sequence.

### NOTEMODE SETTINGS

Learn how to adjust settings for playing notes on Ableton Push.

On a Push 2, the "Note Mode" settings allow you to control which notes are accessible on the pads, primarily by choosing between "In Key" mode (only playing notes within the current key) and "Chromatic" mode (playing all notes), and further customizing the layout of the pads by selecting a specific scale and interval structure using the "Scale" button, enabling you to easily play melodies within a chosen key or scale by simply pressing the corresponding pads on the grid. 

Key points about Note Mode settings on Push 2:

In Key vs. Chromatic:
The primary setting is choosing between "In Key" (only notes from the current key are accessible) and "Chromatic" (all notes are playable). 

Scale Selection:
You can further customize the "In Key" mode by selecting a specific scale, which determines which notes within the key are available on the pads. 

Scale Layout:
The layout of the scale can be adjusted, allowing you to play intervals like thirds or fourths by moving across the pads. 

Accessing Note Mode Settings:
Usually, you can access these settings by pressing the "Scale" button on the Push 2 display, which will then allow you to change the key and scale using the encoders.

## SCENE TEMPO & TIME SIGNATURE

[7.2.1 Editing Scene Tempo and Time Signature Values](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/5595081962524-Scene-Tempo-and-Time-Signature)

Dragging the left edge of the Main track’s title header reveals the Scene Tempo and Scene Time Signature controls, which allow you to assign a tempo and/or time signature to a selected scene. These controls are hidden by default. The project will automatically adjust to these parameters when the scene is launched. To change a scene’s tempo or time signature values:

- Click and drag up or down in any of these fields.

- Click and type a number, then hit Enter.


In Ableton Live, "Scene Tempo and Time Signature" refers to the ability to set a specific tempo (beats per minute) and time signature (how beats are divided within a bar) for each individual scene in your Session View, so when you launch a scene, the project automatically adjusts to that unique rhythmic setting; essentially allowing you to quickly change the feel of your music by switching between scenes with different tempos and time signatures. 

### DO NOT JUST TYPE IN BPM THEY CHANGED IT IN ABELTON 12

Since they changed how you can swith Time signature and BPM in scenes, I have left these videos here because they contain important knowledge even if the original concept no longer applies to the more recent Abelton 12.

[Scene Tempo and Time Signature](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/5595081962524-Scene-Tempo-and-Time-Signature#:~:text=These%20controls%20are%20hidden%20by,cursor%2C%20to%20adjust%20the%20tempo.)

You know how to save a tempo track to a song in Ableton, but what about a song with tempo changes
Using a tempo track is one of my favorite hacks in Ableton Live. It allows you to just drag your song into your set and the tempo comes with it. If you don’t know how to do that, watch this video

## AUTOMATING TEMPO CHANGES

To change the tempo in Ableton Live 12, you can adjust the tempo in a scene or automate tempo changes. 

To automate session tempo changes in Ableton 12, navigate to the Session View, access the Master track, and then either click and drag the left edge of the track header to reveal the "Scene Tempo" control, or enable automation mode (by pressing "A" on your keyboard) to directly draw in tempo changes at specific points within your session using the "Song Tempo" parameter in the automation lane; you can adjust the tempo for each scene by clicking in the tempo field and entering a new BPM value. 

Change the tempo in a scene: 
- Click in the tempo field
- Enter a BPM value between 20 and 999
- Press Enter
- Use the arrow keys or drag the cursor to adjust the tempo
  
Automate tempo changes: 
- Right-click on the tempo box in Arrangement View
- Select Show Automation
- Open the automation lane on the master channel

# ALL OTHER STUFF IN PRODUCTION LIKE DRUM MACHINES AND MUSIC THEORY AND LEGALITIES 
=======================================================================================================

## Drum Patterns, Loops, and Legalities COPYWRITING

### NONE OF THE FOLLOWING IS CONSIDERED LEGAL ADVICE PLEASE SEE A LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN MUSIC WITH QUESTIONS

In most cases, if you use a drum pattern from another song that is easily recognizable and considered a unique part of the original composition, you would likely need to license it, as simply copying a distinct drum pattern could be considered copyright infringement, even if drum patterns alone aren't usually directly copyrightable; however, if you are using a very basic or common rhythm pattern, it might not be considered infringement. 

Basic rhythms are not copyrightable:
Common drum patterns like a simple backbeat or a four-on-the-floor groove are generally considered too generic to be protected by copyright, meaning you can likely use them without licensing. 

Unique and distinctive patterns are:
If a drum pattern is particularly recognizable and considered a key element of a song, like a famous drum fill or a complex rhythmic arrangement, using it without permission could be copyright infringement. 

Sampling vs. playing:
If you are directly sampling a drum loop from another recording, you would definitely need to obtain a license, even if the pattern itself is not unique. 

#### What to do if unsure:

Consult a music lawyer:
If you are unsure whether a specific drum pattern is considered copyrightable or if you want to be completely safe, it's best to consult with a lawyer specializing in music copyright. 

Seek permission:
If you decide to use a recognizable drum pattern, try to contact the original artist or copyright holder to get permission to use it.

# MOOG DFAM
============

The Moog DFAM, which stands for "Drummer From Another Mother", is a semi-modular analog percussion synthesizer designed to create unique percussive sounds and rhythms, considered a part of the Moog Mother-32 family; it features a hands-on approach with an 8-step analog sequencer, two oscillators, a noise generator, and a patchbay allowing for further sound exploration through patching, even though it can be used without extensive patching due to its semi-modular design. 

Key points about the DFAM:

- Percussion focus: Unlike a traditional drum machine, the DFAM is primarily designed for creating percussive sounds like drums, snares, claps, and even more experimental rhythms. 

- Semi-modular: While it has a patchbay for connecting different modules internally, the DFAM can be used without extensive patching thanks to its pre-wired signal flow. 

- Analog sound engine: The DFAM uses completely analog circuitry for a classic, warm sound. 

- 8-step sequencer: The heart of the DFAM, this sequencer allows you to program pitch and velocity for each step, creating intricate rhythmic patterns. 

- Oscillators and noise: The DFAM has two oscillators that can generate square and triangle waveforms, alongside a white noise generator for added texture. 

- Patching capabilities: Although not strictly necessary for basic use, the patch points allow for advanced sound manipulation by connecting different parts of the synthesizer to create unique effects.

DFAM® is the first addition to the Mother-32 family of synthesizers and presents an expressive hands-on approach to percussive pattern creation. It requires no patching, and absolutely no experience is needed for human-beings of any age to quickly begin synthesizing new and unique rhythmic compositions.

# ELEKTRON MACHINE DRUM SPS-1 MKII

The Machinedrum SPS-1 is an advanced drum machine and drum synthesizer. It can synthesize wonderfully convincing analog sounds from the classic drum machines as well as crisp electronic and acoustic drum sounds, and they can all be tweaked and morphed into unique and dynamic new sounds! It has 39 drum sounds ready to be played or tweaked and customized by you! Its eight real-time control knobs offer total hands-on synthesis and control.

At the core of the Machinedrum are four separate percussion instrument synthesizers. They include a TRX synth that emulates Roland's classic TR-series drum machines. An EFM synth that uses FM synthesis to create crispy percussion sounds. The E12 synth is a sample-playback synth using sounds from the E-mu SP1200 and Simmons electronic drum machines. The PI synth uses physical models of acoustic drums for realistic acoustic drums. Each of these synth engines give you excellent quality drum sounds and you can mix and match sounds from all of them among the 16-voice polyphonic drumkits. Your custom 'Kits' can be saved in any of the 64 memory locations. This will also store any custom tweaks you made to the individual drum sounds in each of your kits.

Drum editing features include amplitude modulation, a 1-band EQ, multimode resonant filter, distortion, sample-rate reducer and effects (delay, reverb). All of these parameters are available on each drum sound independently for total control of each sound in your kit! There's also a compressor and 3-band EQ to process the overall mix. Stereo plus four assignable outputs give you plenty options where to send your sounds and the stereo inputs let you trigger drum sounds or process external sounds as a drum voice.

The built-in sequencer offers two programming methods: Classic and Extended. Classic is a pretty limited mode. It works like the classic TR-series in which you assign a drum tone to a 'step' in the pattern using the 16 buttons along the bottom of the instrument. You can store your patterns but the 'Kit' associated with it and any tweaks you do are not stored. Extended mode is more in-depth and stores 'Kit' info with patterns. Extended mode has real and step (grid) time editing, supports odd time signatures, and patterns can have up to 32 steps. Also on-board is an Accent assignable to any step with 15 levels of intensity, and continuously variable swing and slide, assignable to the whole pattern or individual steps within the pattern.

MIDI is fully implemented and can control the sequencer and synthesizer functions of the Machinedrum. Trigger sounds or entire patterns synced to MIDI clock. All edit parameters can be controlled by continuous MIDI controller numbers. This machine has it all, giving you total control and the flexibility to create your own unique drum sounds across a wide range of sonic percussion possibilities!

The best feature is that there are 16 available sounds which can all be individually programmed and processed within the device. Furthermore, you can send out up to six outputs for further processing using external effects.

# Casio Casiotone MT-46

My first casio I recieved when I was just a lass.  I begged for a synth in 9th grade and woke up one Christmas morning to a Casio PT-1 29-Key Mini Synthesizer under my tree.  I wish I still had it but alas due to a house fire it ended up in a plastic puddle in my bedroom next to the vintage 1974 Stereo my mother had given me.  That along with over 1500 casette tapes that were ruined and an original bootlegged pressing of Madonna's Cosmic Climb was the end of my paper route supported legacy of music paraphenilia.

The casio is quinessential 80's.  I don't remember the 80's without it.

This Casiotone is an upgrade from my first Casio.  It is on loan to me from a friend.  I don't think the friend is coming back since they found a tropical paradise.  However I am really the winner because I get all the synth sounds from this glorious still working instrument.

# Korg Monotron

The Korg Monotron Delay produces a classic analog synth sound through a dual-waveform Low Frequency Oscillator using the same acclaimed analog filter VCF circuit as Korg's classic MS-10 and MS-20 semi modular synthesizers.

Alongside the oscillator controls there are indispensable Space Delay controls ideal for swooping, cosmic sounds.
