# Medicinall's Guide to PUSH 2: A vast wealth of compiled knowledge available on the web.

A learning guide for Push 2 Enthusiasts. This is a comprehensive guide for all push 2 users and music producers.  This is meant to be a compiled resource guide. The material that this contains has been made by others.  

## USER STORY

I have spent the last 5 years learning how to compose music in Abelton session while getting my production down and my sound clean.  It has been quite the learning experiance.   Arrangement view is easy and linear.  Session View is a whole other animal.  I have talked to other producers and they hate that Abelton confuses them they couldn't explain why they just hate it.  The more I talked to them the more I discovered that it was to much programming in Session View.  They just want to create and play. Then you have the producers who LOVE session view and the organization of its pieces.  I  LOVE SESSION VIEW as much as I love Arrangement View.  I am happy to report that I am beginnning understand how to compose in session view and make it so that I can play a live set in it if I get all the parts in order.  Thats great but what if I want to compose live and play my push like the instrument it was meant to be?  

This is why I have compiled this source book.  I want to be able to use this as a reference and go back to my favorite sources and look info up in all one place.

I wanted to create a guide where I could have a ton of resources on every subject for the Push 2 in one location and this is what I came up with. As I delve deeper into Abelton I will compile their manual to their videos so it makes this a much easier learning tool.  I will also be putting articles and videos not produced by Abelton but cover the same subject material.  

Learning should be fun and easy and hopefully this guide will take some of the work out of researching so you can learn faster.

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

I hate that most manuals put the shortcuts at the end buried under tons of other information.  Keyboard shortcuts save us time and we can get back to producing.  This is why they are front and center here.  Note: these shortcuts are for Abeleton Live

## Settings and Managing Files in Abelton

The Settings area is your best friend get to know and understand what each setting does and how you can personalize your production experiance.  Settings can be found in the Options menu on Windows and in the Live menu on macOS. You can also open the Settings window using the shortcut Ctrl, (Win) / Cmd, (Mac).

#### FILE MANAGEMENT

This is very crucial but file management is often overlooked until it is to late and then you spend a week crying on your computer and praying to your chosen god or goddess that you didn't delete something crucial.  The sooner you learn this the less stress and more composing you can do.

Various types of files are used in making music with Live, from those containing MIDI and audio, to more program-specific files such as Live Clips and Live Sets. This chapter will explain everything you need to know about working with each of these file types in Live.

## THE MANUAL

What everyone should read but no one does until they need specifics.  This is a handy guide into the Push 2.  I didn't realize the things this beautiful machine could do until I had been playing with it for 2 years.  It's when I started looking into using it as my main tool for live performance that I began to understand why people love this thing.  I also understand why people open it up and then never use it again.  There is so much to learn it becomes overwhelming.  I don't blame people for quitting.  Abelton as a program is vast and when you pair it with a controller that can open the universe, it takes a brave soul to not run away screaming.
