# TOYS AND HOW TO USE THEM

========================================================

This section is all about the gear I have in my studio.  The synthesizers , Drum Machines and Mixers as well as assorted DJ gear.  Who has time for anything else, when you have so many toys to take up ALL of your free time.  

# Roland TR-6S
================

One of my machines and Roland being one of my favorite manufactures of beep boop boop boop toys.  I need to figure out how to utilize this toy better and have put up articles and videos on how to play with this toy and make it a favorite. You can connect it to your computer and you can use it also as a midi device.  You can send all six channels seperately straight into your DAW.  What is not to love about this toy.  

It gives me the drum sounds that I adore with the 606, 707, 808 and 909 drums. Also... FM sounds. Single LFO shared among the instruments.

8 Banks 16 Patterns each.

### Syncing Abelton to the T-8

To sync your Roland TR-8 (or TR-8S) with Ableton Live, you'll need to configure both the TR-8 and Ableton to send and receive MIDI clock signals. This allows the TR-8's sequencer to be synchronized with the tempo of your Ableton project. 

#### Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Connect the TR-8 to your computer:
Use a USB cable to connect the TR-8 to your computer.

3. Configure Ableton Live:
Open Preferences: Go to Live > Preferences.
MIDI Sync: Navigate to the MIDI Sync tab.
TR-8 Sync: Ensure that OUTPUT: TR-8 SYNC is set to ON.
Interface Sync: If the TR-8 is connected to an interface, turn on the corresponding SYNC output in the same section.

5. Configure the TR-8:

Utility Menu: Access the Utility menu by pressing the Utility button. 
MIDI Settings: Select MIDI using the utility screen.

Tempo Sync:

Set Tempo Sync to AUTO. 
Ensure Sync Out is ON. 
Ensure Receive Start/Stop is ON. 

Omni Mode: Keep Omni Mode on for the TR-8. 
USB MIDI Through: Ensure USB MIDI Through and Soft Through are ON. 

7. Optional: Set up the TR-8 as an audio interface in Ableton (for recording audio):
   
* Audio Setup: In Ableton's Preferences > Audio tab, set the Audio Input Device to TR-8.
* Input Config: Enable mono inputs 3-14 under Input Config.
* Track Setup: Create multiple audio tracks in Ableton and assign them to the TR-8's output channels, according to Roland's instructions.
  
9. Start playback in Ableton:
    
* The TR-8 should automatically sync to the tempo of your Ableton project.

  
By following these steps, your Roland TR-8 should be successfully synchronized with Ableton Live, allowing you to use the TR-8 as a rhythmic accompaniment or sequencing device within your Ableton projects. 

This video demonstrates how to connect your Roland TR8-S to Ableton and Record:

# MOOG DFAM
==============================================================

The Moog DFAM, which stands for "Drummer From Another Mother", is a semi-modular analog percussion synthesizer designed to create unique percussive sounds and rhythms, considered a part of the Moog Mother-32 family; it features a hands-on approach with an 8-step analog sequencer, two oscillators, a noise generator, and a patchbay allowing for further sound exploration through patching, even though it can be used without extensive patching due to its semi-modular design. 

Key points about the DFAM:

- Percussion focus: Unlike a traditional drum machine, the DFAM is primarily designed for creating percussive sounds like drums, snares, claps, and even more experimental rhythms. 

- Semi-modular: While it has a patchbay for connecting different modules internally, the DFAM can be used without extensive patching thanks to its pre-wired signal flow. 

- Analog sound engine: The DFAM uses completely analog circuitry for a classic, warm sound. 

- 8-step sequencer: The heart of the DFAM, this sequencer allows you to program pitch and velocity for each step, creating intricate rhythmic patterns. 

- Oscillators and noise: The DFAM has two oscillators that can generate square and triangle waveforms, alongside a white noise generator for added texture. 

- Patching capabilities: Although not strictly necessary for basic use, the patch points allow for advanced sound manipulation by connecting different parts of the synthesizer to create unique effects.

DFAM® is the first addition to the Mother-32 family of synthesizers and presents an expressive hands-on approach to percussive pattern creation. It requires no patching, and absolutely no experience is needed for human-beings of any age to quickly begin synthesizing new and unique rhythmic compositions.

## ELEKTRON MACHINE DRUM SPS-1 MKII
==============================================================

The Machinedrum SPS-1 is an advanced drum machine and drum synthesizer. It can synthesize wonderfully convincing analog sounds from the classic drum machines as well as crisp electronic and acoustic drum sounds, and they can all be tweaked and morphed into unique and dynamic new sounds! It has 39 drum sounds ready to be played or tweaked and customized by you! Its eight real-time control knobs offer total hands-on synthesis and control.

At the core of the Machinedrum are four separate percussion instrument synthesizers. They include a TRX synth that emulates Roland's classic TR-series drum machines. An EFM synth that uses FM synthesis to create crispy percussion sounds. The E12 synth is a sample-playback synth using sounds from the E-mu SP1200 and Simmons electronic drum machines. The PI synth uses physical models of acoustic drums for realistic acoustic drums. Each of these synth engines give you excellent quality drum sounds and you can mix and match sounds from all of them among the 16-voice polyphonic drumkits. Your custom 'Kits' can be saved in any of the 64 memory locations. This will also store any custom tweaks you made to the individual drum sounds in each of your kits.

Drum editing features include amplitude modulation, a 1-band EQ, multimode resonant filter, distortion, sample-rate reducer and effects (delay, reverb). All of these parameters are available on each drum sound independently for total control of each sound in your kit! There's also a compressor and 3-band EQ to process the overall mix. Stereo plus four assignable outputs give you plenty options where to send your sounds and the stereo inputs let you trigger drum sounds or process external sounds as a drum voice.

The built-in sequencer offers two programming methods: Classic and Extended. Classic is a pretty limited mode. It works like the classic TR-series in which you assign a drum tone to a 'step' in the pattern using the 16 buttons along the bottom of the instrument. You can store your patterns but the 'Kit' associated with it and any tweaks you do are not stored. Extended mode is more in-depth and stores 'Kit' info with patterns. Extended mode has real and step (grid) time editing, supports odd time signatures, and patterns can have up to 32 steps. Also on-board is an Accent assignable to any step with 15 levels of intensity, and continuously variable swing and slide, assignable to the whole pattern or individual steps within the pattern.

MIDI is fully implemented and can control the sequencer and synthesizer functions of the Machinedrum. Trigger sounds or entire patterns synced to MIDI clock. All edit parameters can be controlled by continuous MIDI controller numbers. This machine has it all, giving you total control and the flexibility to create your own unique drum sounds across a wide range of sonic percussion possibilities!

The best feature is that there are 16 available sounds which can all be individually programmed and processed within the device. Furthermore, you can send out up to six outputs for further processing using external effects.

# Casio Casiotone MT-46
===========================================

My first casio I recieved when I was just a lass.  I begged for a synth in 9th grade and woke up one Christmas morning to a Casio PT-1 29-Key Mini Synthesizer under my tree.  I wish I still had it but alas due to a house fire it ended up in a plastic puddle in my bedroom next to the vintage 1974 Stereo my mother had given me.  That along with over 1500 casette tapes that were ruined and an original bootlegged pressing of Madonna's Cosmic Climb was the end of my paper route supported legacy of music paraphenilia.

The casio is quinessential 80's.  I don't remember the 80's without it.

This Casiotone is an upgrade from my first Casio.  It is on loan to me from a friend.  I don't think the friend is coming back since they found a tropical paradise.  However I am really the winner because I get all the synth sounds from this glorious still working instrument.

# Korg Monotron Delay
=============================================

The Korg Monotron Delay produces a classic analog synth sound through a dual-waveform Low Frequency Oscillator using the same acclaimed analog filter VCF circuit as Korg's classic MS-10 and MS-20 semi modular synthesizers.

Alongside the oscillator controls there are indispensable Space Delay controls ideal for swooping, cosmic sounds.

The Korg Monotron Delay is a remarkable budget delay effect, costing only around $50 and featuring all-analog circuitry. The Lo-Fi distortion it provides heavily resembles the sound of 4 track cassette decks and reminds me just how incredible this tool is.

I purchased this baby on a whim for $35 and love ALL THE SPACE SOUNDS it makes.
