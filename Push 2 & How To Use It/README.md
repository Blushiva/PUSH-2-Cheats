## Connecting your Audio from Push 2 to the sound system

To hook up a Push 2 into a sound system, connect it directly to your computer via USB, then route the audio output from your computer's audio interface to your sound system; essentially, the Push 2 acts as a MIDI controller, sending control data to your computer which then produces sound through your chosen audio interface and into the speakers. 

Key points to remember:
- Direct connection: Plug the Push 2's USB cable into your computer. 
- Audio interface: You'll need a separate audio interface connected to your computer to send the audio from your Ableton Live session to your sound system. 
- Software setup: Within your DAW (like Ableton Live), configure the audio input and output settings to route the audio from your Push 2 through your chosen audio interface. 


## USING THE PUSH 2

[Using Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/using-push-2/)  

Much of Push 2’s behavior depends on which mode it is in, as well as on which type of track is selected. To help you learn how to work with Push 2, this chapter will walk you through some of the fundamental workflows, and then will provide a reference of all of Push 2’s controls.

[Browsing and Loading Songs](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#browsing-and-loading-sounds)

You can browse and load sounds directly from Push 2, without needing to use Live’s browser. This is done in Push 2’s Browse Mode.

[Playing and Programming Beats](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#playing-and-programming-beats)

To create beats using Push 2, first make sure Note Mode is enabled

- [LOOP SELECTOR](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#loop-selector)  When the Loop Selector layout is enabled, the pads are divided into three sections, allowing you to simultaneously play, step sequence and adjust the length of your clip.
- [16 Velocities Mode](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#velocities-mode) Press the Layout button to switch to the 16 Velocities layout. In this mode, the bottom right 16 pads represent 16 different velocities for the selected Drum Rack pad. Tap one of the velocity pads to enter steps at that velocity.
- [64 Pad Mode](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#pad-mode) You can also use the entire 8x8 pad grid for real-time drum playing. This is useful when working with very large drum kits, such as those created by slicing. To switch to 64-pad mode, press the Layout button again.
- [Loading Individual Drums](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#loading-individual-drums) Browse Mode can also be used to load or replace individual pads within a loaded Drum Rack. To switch between browsing Drum Racks and single pads, make sure you’re in Device Mode by pressing the Device button. This will show the devices on the track.  
- [Step Sequencing Beats](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#step-sequencing-beats) Tapping a pad selects it and also enables it for step sequencing.  To record notes with the step sequencer, tap the pads in the step sequencer controls to place notes in the clip where you want them. The clip will begin playing as soon as you tap a step. By default, each step sequencer pad corresponds to a 16th note, but you can change the step size via the Scene/Grid buttons.

#### Recording

- [Real Time Recording](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#real-time-recording)  Drum patterns can also be recorded in real-time by playing the Drum Rack pads. Follow these steps to record in real-time
  
- [Fixed Length Recording](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#fixed-length-recording)
  Press the Fixed Length button to set the size of new clips to a predetermined length.
  
[Additional Recording Options](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#additional-recording-options)  Here are a few other recording options that you should be aware of.
- [Recoding with Repeat](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#recording-with-repeat)  With Push 2’s Repeat button enabled, you can hold down a pad to play or record a stream of continuous, rhythmically-even notes. This is useful for recording steady hi-hat patterns, for example. Varying your finger pressure on the pad will change the volume of the repeated notes.
- [Quantizing](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#quantizing)  Pressing Push 2’s Quantize button will snap notes to the grid in the selected clip.
- [Arrangement Recording](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#arrangement-recording)  When Live’s Arrangement View is in focus in the software, pressing Record will toggle Arrangement Recording on and off. While Arrangement Recording is on, all of your actions on Push 2 are recorded into the Arrangement View

## How to Create a Master set playing Live 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2bKa_WnnJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2bKa_WnnJA)  If you plan on using Ableton Live on stage for stems, multitracks, or backing tracks, you'll want to load multiple songs into one Ableton Live Set for the best experience. To have access to all your songs from that set, and for the best transitions, you don't want to load indivual song files.

## Step Sequencing Beats

- [Step Sequencing Beats](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#step-sequencing-beats) Tapping a pad selects it and also enables it for step sequencing.  To record notes with the step sequencer, tap the pads in the step sequencer controls to place notes in the clip where you want them. The clip will begin playing as soon as you tap a step. By default, each step sequencer pad corresponds to a 16th note, but you can change the step size via the Scene/Grid buttons.
  
"Step sequencing beats" in Ableton means creating a drum beat by programming individual notes (or "steps") in a sequence, where each step represents a specific rhythmic division within a bar, allowing you to build a rhythm pattern by activating specific steps in a grid-like interface, usually using the pads on a controller like Ableton Push, to trigger different drum sounds one after another to form a beat. 
Learn how to program beats using the step sequencer on Ableton Push.

- Key points about step sequencing beats in Ableton:
  
Grid-based interface:
The step sequencer displays a grid where each column represents a "step" and can be programmed with a note to trigger a sound. 

Customizable step length:
You can adjust the length of each step to create different rhythmic patterns, like 16th notes, 8th notes, triplets, etc. 

Drum Rack integration:
Most commonly used with a Drum Rack, which allows you to easily select different drum sounds on each step. 

Live recording:
You can also record a beat in real-time by pressing the pads in sequence, and the software will quantize the notes to the selected step length. 

How to step sequence beats in Ableton:

1. **Select a drum rack:**
Load a drum rack in your MIDI track to access various drum sounds. 

2. **Choose a step length:**
Set the desired step division (e.g., 16th notes) in the step sequencer settings. 

3. **Trigger steps:**
Press the corresponding pads on your controller to activate the desired drum sounds on each step. 

4. **Build a pattern:**
Repeat this process to create a complete rhythmic pattern across multiple steps. 

**Benefits of step sequencing:** 
Intuitive rhythm creation: The visual grid makes it easy to visualize and manipulate rhythms. 
Rapid prototyping: Quickly experiment with different beat variations by changing the active steps. 
Precise control: Fine-tune the timing and velocity of each step for detailed rhythm creation.

## PLAYING DRUMS IN ABLETON

Drums are the foundation of music.  Playing drums in ableton is a great way to make your track stand out. 
Drums are considered one of the most important instruments in music because they provide the rhythmic foundation, setting the tempo and driving the energy of a song, essentially acting as the "timekeeper" that keeps all other instruments in sync and allows for dynamic shifts in intensity and emotion within a piece; without drums, music can often feel lackluster and unfocused. 

Drums are primarily responsible for creating the rhythmic pulse that listeners naturally move to, providing a clear sense of time and structure within a song. 

A drummer can significantly influence the mood of a song by adjusting the tempo, dynamics, and patterns, adding energy, excitement, or a sense of calm depending on the situation. 

Different drum styles and techniques can be used to create a wide range of sounds and textures, adapting to various musical genres.

## Melodies in Ableton

A melody in a song acts as the "tune" or main musical line, defining the song's character, conveying emotions, and serving as the most memorable part that listeners typically recognize and hum along to; essentially, it's the sequence of notes that tells the musical story within a song. 

A melody is what distinguishes one song from another, making it the most recognizable element.  By using different pitch patterns and rhythms, a melody can convey a wide range of emotions, from joy to sadness. 
The melody dictates the order and duration of notes, forming the overall structure of the song.  A good melody is often considered "catchy" because it is easy to remember and sing along to. 

A melody can be defined as a sequence of single notes that are musically pleasing to the listener. It's the part of a song which is most memorable and is often referred to as the tune.

A melody is one of the basic elements of music. Melodies are the part of music that is above the chords and rhythm. They can come in many shapes and sizes, and can have lyrics or be instrumental. They can be played very high, or very low. We can hear them played by instruments like a violin, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, or sung by a voice. The most important thing to remember is that they are always only one pitch at a time. 

Musical ideas can be hard to explain and are often defined by using complex Italian music terms, or using difficult music theory — but Melody may be the simplest and easiest musical concept musicians have.

## Chords In Ableton

A chord in music is a group of notes that are played simultaneously to create harmony. Chords are built from intervals of notes, such as thirds and fifths. 
Types of chords: 

Triad: A chord made up of three notes: a root note, a third, and a fifth 

7th chord: A chord made up of four notes, also known as a tetrad 

Extended chord: A chord made up of five or more notes 

Diminished chord: A chord made up of a root note, a minor third, and a diminished fifth 

Augmented chord: A chord made up of a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth 

Chord qualities: 

Consonant: A chord that implies repose

Dissonant: A chord that implies resolution to another chord
Uses of chords 

Accompaniment: Chords provide the backdrop for melodies

Songwriting: Chord progressions are often the starting point for writing songs
Improvisation: Understanding chords helps musicians improvise

Arrangement: Chords are important for arranging music for different instruments and ensembles

## CHROMATIC NOTE MODE

Chromatic note mode is a mode on some musical instruments that allows the player to access all 12 notes of an octave. It can be used to create melodies, embellish other scales, or tune instruments. 

How it works:

The chromatic scale is made up of all the white and black keys on a piano. 
Each note in the chromatic scale is a half step apart. 
Sharps move up a half step, while flats move down a half step. 
The chromatic scale doesn't have a tonal center, so it doesn't gravitate towards a particular tone. 

When to use it:

Leads: Chromatic mode can be used to create leads. 
Classical impressionism: Chromatic mode can be used to create a classical impressionist sound. 
Pitch bending: Chromatic mode can be used for pitch bending. 
Tuning: Chromatic mode can be used to tune an instrument to any of the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale. 
Embellishing other scales: Chromatic mode can be used to embellish the tones of major and minor scales.
Evoking emotion: Chromatic mode can be used to evoke grief, loss, or sorrow.

## Melodic Parts

Melodic parts are the notes that make up the tune, or melody, of a piece of music. The melody is often the most memorable part of a song. 

Pitch: The notes that make up the melody
Rhythm: The pattern of pitches in time
Structure: The arrangement of notes, including intervals, scales, motifs, and phrasing
Dynamics: How loud or soft the melody is played
Texture: The density of the layers of sounds, melodies, and rhythms
Timbre: The quality of the sound

In this Ableton Push tutorial video you’ll learn how to transform and tweak sounds by adjusting the parameters or adding effects.

To step sequence notes and chords using the melodic step sequencer on Ableton Push, press the "Layout" button to access the melodic step sequencer mode, then simply press the pads corresponding to the desired notes on the grid, where each pad represents a step in the sequence; you can play single notes or chords by pressing multiple pads simultaneously depending on the scale you've selected. 

Key points to remember:

Accessing the Melodic Step Sequencer: Press the "Layout" button on Push to toggle between different modes, including the melodic step sequencer. 

Playing Notes: Once in the melodic step sequencer, the pads will represent notes of a chosen scale, with the bottom row typically being the root notes and the top row an octave higher. 

Creating Chords: To play a chord, press multiple pads within the same step simultaneously. 

Navigating the Scale: Use the scale controls on Push to select the desired scale and root note. 

Step Length and Resolution: Adjust the step length and resolution using the dedicated buttons on Push to control how long each note lasts within the sequence.

### NOTEMODE SETTINGS

Learn how to adjust settings for playing notes on Ableton Push.

On a Push 2, the "Note Mode" settings allow you to control which notes are accessible on the pads, primarily by choosing between "In Key" mode (only playing notes within the current key) and "Chromatic" mode (playing all notes), and further customizing the layout of the pads by selecting a specific scale and interval structure using the "Scale" button, enabling you to easily play melodies within a chosen key or scale by simply pressing the corresponding pads on the grid. 

Key points about Note Mode settings on Push 2:

In Key vs. Chromatic:
The primary setting is choosing between "In Key" (only notes from the current key are accessible) and "Chromatic" (all notes are playable). 

Scale Selection:
You can further customize the "In Key" mode by selecting a specific scale, which determines which notes within the key are available on the pads. 

Scale Layout:
The layout of the scale can be adjusted, allowing you to play intervals like thirds or fourths by moving across the pads. 

Accessing Note Mode Settings:
Usually, you can access these settings by pressing the "Scale" button on the Push 2 display, which will then allow you to change the key and scale using the encoders.

## Session View

Push 2’s Session Overview lets you navigate through large Live Sets quickly without looking at your computer screen.

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to Session Overview, where the pad grid zooms out to reveal an overview of your Session View. You can also lock the Session Overview in place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the Session Overview, press the Layout button again.

In the Session Overview, each pad represents an eight-scene-by-eight-track block of clips, giving you a matrix of 64 scenes by 64 tracks. Hit a pad to focus on that section of the Session View. For example, pressing the pad in row three, column one will put the focus on scenes 17-24 and tracks 1-8. Furthermore, each scene launch button represents a block of 64 scenes (if they are available in your Set.)

In the Session Overview, the color coding is a little different:

- White: indicates the currently selected block of clips, which will be surrounded by the colored border in the software.
- Green: there are clips playing in that block of clips (though that may not be the block of clips selected).
- No color: there are no tracks or scenes in that range.
