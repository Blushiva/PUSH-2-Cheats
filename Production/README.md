## Drum Patterns, Loops, and Legalities COPYWRITING

### NONE OF THE FOLLOWING IS CONSIDERED LEGAL ADVICE PLEASE SEE A LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN MUSIC WITH QUESTIONS

In most cases, if you use a drum pattern from another song that is easily recognizable and considered a unique part of the original composition, you would likely need to license it, as simply copying a distinct drum pattern could be considered copyright infringement, even if drum patterns alone aren't usually directly copyrightable; however, if you are using a very basic or common rhythm pattern, it might not be considered infringement. 

Basic rhythms are not copyrightable:
Common drum patterns like a simple backbeat or a four-on-the-floor groove are generally considered too generic to be protected by copyright, meaning you can likely use them without licensing. 

Unique and distinctive patterns are:
If a drum pattern is particularly recognizable and considered a key element of a song, like a famous drum fill or a complex rhythmic arrangement, using it without permission could be copyright infringement. 

Sampling vs. playing:
If you are directly sampling a drum loop from another recording, you would definitely need to obtain a license, even if the pattern itself is not unique. 

#### What to do if unsure:

Consult a music lawyer:
If you are unsure whether a specific drum pattern is considered copyrightable or if you want to be completely safe, it's best to consult with a lawyer specializing in music copyright. 

Seek permission:
If you decide to use a recognizable drum pattern, try to contact the original artist or copyright holder to get permission to use it.

## Equalizers

An equalizer (EQ) is a tool used in audio systems to adjust the volume of specific frequency ranges within a sound, allowing you to boost or cut certain frequencies to improve the overall sound quality by making elements like bass, midrange, and treble more prominent or subdued depending on your preference; essentially, it lets you "shape" the sound by manipulating different parts of the frequency spectrum. 

Key points about equalizers:
- Frequency bands:
EQs are divided into different frequency bands, like low bass, midrange, and high treble, allowing you to target specific parts of the audio spectrum. 
- Boosting and cutting:
By adjusting the sliders or knobs on an EQ, you can increase (boost) the volume of a particular frequency range or decrease (cut) it to reduce its presence. 
- Applications:
Equalizers are commonly used in music production to fine-tune individual instruments or vocals, in live sound reinforcement to adjust room acoustics, and in car audio systems to customize the sound experience.

What Is EQ Or Equalization?

Equalization – or EQ – is one of the most well-known forms of audio processing in music production. With EQ, you can adjust the volume level of a frequency (or range of frequencies) within a sound, which in turn allows you to cure a sound – or sometimes even entire songs – of its imperfections. This is done by cutting unwanted frequencies and/or boosting others, all to balance out sounds so they work well with one another.

## Compressors

A compressor is a music production tool that reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of an audio signal. This process is called compression. 

How compressors are used: 
- To make loud parts quieter, which helps maintain a consistent level
- To add presence, thickness, and snap to a sound
- To create a professional, finished sound
- To even out dynamics in a track

Types of compressors

- VCA
Voltage controlled amplifier compressors are known for their precise control and predictable sound 
 
- FET
Field effect transistor compressors are fast acting and are great for transient heavy material like drums, acoustic guitars, and bass guitars 

Parallel compression 
- A technique that blends a compressed signal with the original uncompressed sound
- This technique is often used when mixing drums to achieve a balance between punch and sustain

Other compressors:  
- Chandler Limited TG12345
- UREI LA-4
- Pendulum Audio PL-2
- Vertigo Sound VSC-2
- FabFilter Pro-C 2
- Softube CL 1B

What is compression in music?

Compression reduces the overall dynamic range of a piece of audio by detecting when it exceeds a specified level, and then attenuating it by a specified amount. Put simply, it narrows the difference between the loudest and softest parts of a track so that it’s more consistent in level.
