## Drum Patterns, Loops, and Legalities COPYWRITING

### NONE OF THE FOLLOWING IS CONSIDERED LEGAL ADVICE PLEASE SEE A LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN MUSIC WITH QUESTIONS

In most cases, if you use a drum pattern from another song that is easily recognizable and considered a unique part of the original composition, you would likely need to license it, as simply copying a distinct drum pattern could be considered copyright infringement, even if drum patterns alone aren't usually directly copyrightable; however, if you are using a very basic or common rhythm pattern, it might not be considered infringement. 

Basic rhythms are not copyrightable:
Common drum patterns like a simple backbeat or a four-on-the-floor groove are generally considered too generic to be protected by copyright, meaning you can likely use them without licensing. 

Unique and distinctive patterns are:
If a drum pattern is particularly recognizable and considered a key element of a song, like a famous drum fill or a complex rhythmic arrangement, using it without permission could be copyright infringement. 

Sampling vs. playing:
If you are directly sampling a drum loop from another recording, you would definitely need to obtain a license, even if the pattern itself is not unique. 

#### What to do if unsure:

Consult a music lawyer:
If you are unsure whether a specific drum pattern is considered copyrightable or if you want to be completely safe, it's best to consult with a lawyer specializing in music copyright. 

Seek permission:
If you decide to use a recognizable drum pattern, try to contact the original artist or copyright holder to get permission to use it.
