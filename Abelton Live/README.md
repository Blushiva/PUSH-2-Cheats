## SCENE TEMPO & TIME SIGNATURE

[7.2.1 Editing Scene Tempo and Time Signature Values](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/5595081962524-Scene-Tempo-and-Time-Signature)

Dragging the left edge of the Main track’s title header reveals the Scene Tempo and Scene Time Signature controls, which allow you to assign a tempo and/or time signature to a selected scene. These controls are hidden by default. The project will automatically adjust to these parameters when the scene is launched. To change a scene’s tempo or time signature values:

- Click and drag up or down in any of these fields.

- Click and type a number, then hit Enter.


In Ableton Live, "Scene Tempo and Time Signature" refers to the ability to set a specific tempo (beats per minute) and time signature (how beats are divided within a bar) for each individual scene in your Session View, so when you launch a scene, the project automatically adjusts to that unique rhythmic setting; essentially allowing you to quickly change the feel of your music by switching between scenes with different tempos and time signatures. 

### DO NOT JUST TYPE IN BPM THEY CHANGED IT IN ABELTON 12

Since they changed how you can swith Time signature and BPM in scenes, I have left these videos here because they contain important knowledge even if the original concept no longer applies to the more recent Abelton 12.

In this tutorial, Liam O'Mullane shows you how to swiftly deploy tempo and time signature changes into your Arrangement View. You'll also learn how to make the same changes in your Session View, and understand ways in which to make these changes on-the-fly during a live performance. Liam also shows you how to create polymeters, which have the potential to make your tracks more musically fascinating.

What if my song has a lot of tempo changes?”  In this tutorial, you’ll learn what to do in that situation, and a trick I recently used to be able to have flexibility and change tempo live in the moment.

[Ableton Tutorial: What To Do When Your Song Has Tempo Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBioNnlJZ4)

You know how to save a tempo track to a song in Ableton, but what about a song with tempo changes
Using a tempo track is one of my favorite hacks in Ableton Live. It allows you to just drag your song into your set and the tempo comes with it. If you don’t know how to do that, watch this video

## AUTOMATING TEMPO CHANGES

To change the tempo in Ableton Live 12, you can adjust the tempo in a scene or automate tempo changes. 

To automate session tempo changes in Ableton 12, navigate to the Session View, access the Master track, and then either click and drag the left edge of the track header to reveal the "Scene Tempo" control, or enable automation mode (by pressing "A" on your keyboard) to directly draw in tempo changes at specific points within your session using the "Song Tempo" parameter in the automation lane; you can adjust the tempo for each scene by clicking in the tempo field and entering a new BPM value. 

Change the tempo in a scene: 
- Click in the tempo field
- Enter a BPM value between 20 and 999
- Press Enter
- Use the arrow keys or drag the cursor to adjust the tempo
  
Automate tempo changes: 
- Right-click on the tempo box in Arrangement View
- Select Show Automation
- Open the automation lane on the master channel
- Add break points or notes to change the tempo
- You can also automate tempo changes in a specific clip using the Automate Tempo BPM device in Session View.

Automating gradual tempo changes in Ableton Live's arrangement view is pretty easy BUT what about in session view??? In this Ableton Live tutorial, They show you how to create automated tempo changes in Ableton Live's session view (on a Mac). Using this technique is useful for gradual and seamless transitions between tracks allowing you to maintain momentum in your live performances. No more stopping between songs or manual tempo changes.

[BEGINNERS GUIDE TO SWING AND GROOVE (ABLETON 12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r6IiwJcEEE)

As most of us don't play in a band these days and create all our songs in a DAW, everything has sounded more and more robotic. This can be good in certain styles of music, but not all the time. With these simple steps you can sound like your tracks have been played and recorded in live. 

## LIVE'S MIXER

[LIVE'S MIXER](https://youtu.be/P1Y1FEcw2xQ)

## SIMPLER

In Ableton Live, "Simpler" is a built-in sampler device that is considered a streamlined and user-friendly version of the more complex "Sampler" instrument, allowing producers to easily manipulate and play back single audio samples with basic controls, making it ideal for quick sample-based sound design and creating instruments from single sounds with minimal fuss; essentially, it's a simplified way to sample and play audio clips across a keyboard. 

The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that, for any given tool or technique, roughly 80% of the outcome comes from using just 20% of the available resources. Looking at the way many of us use Ableton Live, this 80/20 rule very likely applies to Simpler and Sampler; with most of us only ever scratching the surface of what these devices are capable of. This is fine of course if you’re happy with the musical results you’re getting, but what else could you do with that other 80%?

Enter Evan Chandler, aka electro-boogie artist Slynk. His recent tutorial video showed off a whole bunch of techniques that explored the creative possibilities of using Live’s Vocoder not just for vocals. In a similar vein, Chandler’s new tutorial video dives deep into Simpler and Sampler to demonstrate some fun, under-the-radar tricks for slicing up samples, generating melodies and making your own bass synth (or donk machine). In addition, Slynk drops lots of pro tips on how to use Simpler and Sampler with filters, arpeggiators, LFOs, envelopes, and the mysterious ‘Zn Shift’ parameter.

This tutorial covers all of the Playback Modes (Classic, 1Shot & Slice), and what happens both in sample view and device view (Filters, LFO, Envelope(s) & Global controls). I also show how to convert your sliced sample to a drum rack and to a MIDI track.

[Warping in Simpler](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072629-Warping-in-Simpler)

Simpler is capable of Warping samples, which changes the pitch of a sample without affecting its speed or conversely changing the speed of a sample without affecting its pitch.

A few limitations in the Simpler Warping engine can lead to unexpected results - here's a brief run-through.

- CPU issues with Complex/Pro Complex and Pro Warp modes can often provide the best sound when warping Clips, especially when aiming for a natural sounding transposition/time stretching.  Due to very high CPU requirements, it is advisable to use these sparingly and only whenever no other Warp mode seems adequate.
- Playing several notes on Simpler when Complex or Pro are in use might cause the audio engine to drop out.
Drop outs can also occur when using these Warp modes with high transposition values or high stretch factors ( e.g. using the "x2" button).
Triggering the same note/pad very quickly (e.g. via Push repeat button) can also quickly cause drop outs.
Finally, very short loops will most likely introduce drop outs with the above mentioned Warp modes.
How to improve things
- Ideally, only one track at a time should use Complex/Pro in a set: freezing the track, when possible, would be a good solution in order to free up CPU resources before moving on to use Complex on a different Simpler instance.
- Freezing a track is a good way to save CPU resources.
- Keeping the voice count low is also a good way to avoid drop outs.
- Setting the device poliphony to 1 will force Simpler to never use more than one voice.
- Setting the device polyphony to 1 will force Simpler to never use more than one voice.
- Also note that when in Slicing mode, clicks might occur at slice start/end. In this case, the problem is easily solved by adjusting the fade in/fade out controls in Simpler's Envelope section.
- Fade In and Fade Out controls help you removing clicks at the beginning and at slice end / start.
- Finally, it is not recommended to use Complex or Pro in Drum Racks. If you need to time stretch drum samples, it is advisable to use the other available Warp modes.
- Loop crossfade  No Loop Crossfade is available when Warp is active on Simpler. This is in order to keep a low voice count, which might otherwise introduce performance issues.
- Warp settings updated on a per-note basis
- Tweaks for Warp settings (e.g. Grain Size and Flux when Texture is in use) are only updated each time a new note is pressed.
- Legato and glide in Beats mode
- The Beats Warp mode is not recommended when using Legato or Glide. In this mode, the pitch is only updated at each new transient, or time denomination, so no glissando effect will take place.
